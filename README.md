## *Systems and Thought Process*

The development was carried out iteratively, prioritizing core functionality and responsive player control before refining visual or structural aspects. Starting with the movement system in C++ was a deliberate choice to ensure full control over physics, collision, and the dynamic behavior of the skateboard, establishing a solid foundation for future features.

For animations, I chose to integrate them in a way that respects their actual execution timing—such as delaying the push impulse until after the pushing animation starts—using timers and montages to sync logic and visuals. For jumping, I introduced vector curves to control the skateboard’s rotation while in the air, adding dynamism without compromising structural clarity.

In total, only 8.5 hours of work were invested, divided into two overnight sessions: from 11:30 PM to 5:00 AM on the first night, and from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM on the second.

## *My Performance*

Finally, I’d like to apologize for not being able to complete the test. Despite the focused effort during the nights, I am currently working full-time, and unfortunately, receiving the test on Monday significantly affected my ability to deliver everything within the expected timeframe—more than I initially anticipated. I’m confident that in a different context, I could perform at a much higher level. Thank you very much for the opportunity, and I hope to return in the future and show the full extent of what I’m capable of.
